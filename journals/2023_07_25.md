	- yesterday was  spent on the discussion and provided inputs should works closely with the group, Also ended day on right time. should focus on closing the day before 7 pm so that we can focus on other works and personal things,
	- So much delegation happening between the works we need to ensure this is not happening, i should close any work which is not taking more 30 mins of time so that we can get things done, rather than keeping them
