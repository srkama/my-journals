	- [[May 29th, 2023]] was good able to complete few things and was active during the meetings, I want to keep similar kind of engagement with the group to provide clear updates,
	- Personally not started anything yet, i could not go to the driving school and make any progress should complete this today.
	- start on walking that is one thing I can do to improve the health, good that last few days there is no outside food, which good. should stick homemade foods as much as possible
	- Another thing happened for learning One thing i can do this to block like 10 to 20 hours per week on learning, should i enrol to the habit strong program is a question? I see more productivity on those days lets enrol again to the same program. Or may be i should plan my work deep work session, during the day. 7:45 to 9:30 seems to good one lets try to do this.
