	- I am not planning anything for the day i am postponing everything. Mostly due laziness and should plan things and close. May be should come up with weekly and daily plans for my day that may help me to solve these issues.
	- I am not always focusing on important things i have to come up with what is most important things for the day and plan my activities accordingly.
	- Missing the personal relationship i should speak to people on regular basis and ensure i speak, should i create an planner when to call someone? not sure something holds me and not able to proceed to further here. I should accept whatever happens in my life and proceed with things. This is a big mistake I am doing.
