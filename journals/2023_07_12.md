	- Getting worser day by day not able to focus on anything and got tried probably I need to take some break and refresh my mind
	- So many issues and projects happening may need to prioritise things based on priority
	- should not rush to get a job, rather, review pros and cons of each role and work and then decide how to go about it.
	- Also reach out to person on regular basis and look for new opportunities and should keep in touch with people
