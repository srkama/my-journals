	- still confused and concerned about the #Tridiv comment on me. he is more concerned about taking leaves on monday and friday. we should make it clear. I do not know whom to reach out and discuss this matter. I will focus on the improving and change images of mine but if it is not working should look out.
	- I need spending building morning habits, to start with will change my wakeup time to early morning 5 AM and to a mediation for 10 mins. lets see how it goes, can also walk in evening for one more hour.
	- I think buying monitor or table may not required now, lets not do this now lets see if still required we will buy this later.
