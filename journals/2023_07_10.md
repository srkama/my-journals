	- Yesterday was well spent i see some works that can be accomplished related to work and other areas
	- rather working on the things, i should focus on writing strategic documents for all services and list out all things we want to do
	- Reading and listening to podcasts oneway  to keep me motivated and focus o learning something new always, this will be really helpful in long run.
	- stay focused on problem solving and improve the solution.
