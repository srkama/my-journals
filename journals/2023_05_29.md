	- Still procastinating  on driving class and buying car. I should take both seriously and work on it
	- I feel do to work on things but not focusing on important things I should be doing it, I should make a plan and work it, also going forward I need to focus on delivery high value tasks and delegate as much as possible to the group not sticking around
