	- I have spent two days without doing much, yesterday was not worked as per the plan. I was feeling bad during badminton play i should focus on what i can do and how can i improve further.
	- I need plan activities and do what is important first and then plan next set of items, delegate as much as i can to different set of peoples, i should not try to do all by myself i should build ally for me, so when i am not available still team run smoothly.
	- Focus on job search regularly and lets try to get better role than now, so that in next few year i reach position where i want to be.
