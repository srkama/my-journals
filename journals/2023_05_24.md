	- Yesterday was not went well, there two many things going on, I think I should plan things  and move properly, I need to do more delegation than actual work,
	- lets try to capture all work that is needed and plan what needs to be done at priority.
	- I want to focus on learning and also move towards the bigger role and should plan the activities properly.
		- The actions i am doing now will define my career progression
	- More and More delegation is what needed to deliver results.
	- I should also start with blogging, and writing and knowledge sharing that will help me set my profile.
