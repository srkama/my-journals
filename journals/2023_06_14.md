	- [[Jun 13th, 2023]] was okay, not much of progress there two many things to followup, and not able to follow through the works that are needed
	- I should not rush to close things rather than i should focus on getting the right things done at right time.
	- One more thing i am seeing using phone too much not even spending time on reading, i should focus on reading as well. that is important keep my moe and motivation level proper.
	- Good that most of my backlogs are getting cleared i should focus on taking up one by one thing.
