- While some tech CEOs may be tempted to abandon tried-and-true management methods, it's increasingly clear that effective management is crucial for building engineering teams that ship impactful products. Clear responsibilities, roles, and structure are fundamental for achieving scale. So while eliminating layers of middle management may seem cool in this ‚ÄúFOMO Layoff Era,‚Äù a structured approach is essential for unlocking teams' full potential.
- Over the past decade, the tech industry has significantly shifted how we approach building software products. While programming may be an individual activity, shipping software professionally is a social undertaking that requires effective collaboration. Thanks to the increasing public discourse around engineering management, we're moving away from secretive internal structures and outdated practices passed down via oral tradition, like measuring lines of code üôÑ.
- Before you stop reading because you‚Äôre not leading a product engineering team, think again. If someone uses the software you ship, inside or outside your company, you have users, so ü•≥ congratulations ü•≥, you‚Äôre leading a product engineering team whether you want it or not. Let‚Äôs move along.
- Like an engineering ladder, but for teams
  Camille's post on Engineering Ladders, which was groundbreaking when first published a few years ago, opened up new possibilities for me and many others in the industry.
- What if we considered teams the fundamental units for software delivery, and built a similar framework?
- With this post, I'm excited to share an experiment that builds on the concept of levels/competencies and incorporates them into a framework that considers teams, rather than individuals, as the fundamental unit of effectiveness in software engineering.
- Team effectiveness doesn't rest solely on managers. Yes, the PM/EM partnership is ultimately responsible for team performance, but everyone on the team contributes to the results. To help my current engineering organization evolve, we drafted a framework that outlines what a capable team looks like so that individual team members can understand how they contribute to effectiveness teams. Ultimately, you need a sprinkling of glue work to turn a collection of individuals into a cohesive team.
- This framework provides clear guidelines for team members to work together and collaborate effectively, especially at a distance. This collection of expected capabilities encourages teams to take collective ownership of their outcomes and serve our customers' needs in the most impactful way possible. Additionally, this structure allows teams to focus on delivering results and achieving success.
- For instance, rather than prescribing a specific method for reporting progress, we clarify who needs to be informed and provide examples of a need for more communication. The team can decide who communicates with the relevant parties: the engineering manager, tech lead, product manager, or an individual engineer. An effective team will achieve the expected communication outcomes of broadcasting status. If I had to go digging in a task tracker to understand the status of a team, they are not meeting the communication expectations.
- Just like the rollout of a traditional engineering ladder, the successful deployment of a capability framework requires a few steps:
- Defining team capabilities: This involves identifying the critical skills and competencies essential for effective collaboration and performance within a team.
  Assessing team effectiveness: Once the team's capabilities are defined, it's essential to have a system to determine how well the team performs based on those capabilities. Teams can assess themselves with the support of management and executive leadership.
  Identifying areas for improvement: Based on the assessment, the team can determine where they need to improve, whether in specific competencies or their overall approach to collaboration and effectiveness.
  Providing a path for growth and development: Finally, the capability framework offers a path for growth and development that enables the team to continue improving and evolving. Effective teams should be more impactful over time without having to grow significantly in size or work longer hours.
  An effective product engineering team can ‚Ä¶
  Capabilities broadly describe the skills and responsibilities we expect from our teams and help us establish clear expectations and outcomes. However, we recognize that it can be challenging to capture all of these expectations without creating a lengthy and confusing operational manual.

- Wrapping up
  As a product engineering executive, I‚Äôve come to realize how important it is to have a clear set of capabilities that enable our teams to deliver great products. Having a shared understanding of what it takes to be successful helps us prioritize our work and make informed decisions.
- While capabilities may be specific to your organization, they can serve as a useful framework for driving organizational effectiveness in the same way engineering ladders serve individuals when properly deployed. For both of these tools, it‚Äôs important to consider technical skills and core skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.
- If you can try a similar approach with your organization, please share your experience so we can continue learning in the open. By reflecting on our capabilities and identifying areas for improvement, we can continue to grow and deliver better products.
- Finally, let‚Äôs remember that teams are the fundamental unit for software delivery. By focusing on our capabilities and working together, we can ship impactful products.
